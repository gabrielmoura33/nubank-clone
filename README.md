# Nubank Interface Clone
My Nubank interface clone, using React Native + Expo. 🧑🏾‍💻

That's my interface clone of the nubank app.
On this clone i've experienced for the first time the **Animated API**. The Animated Api it's designed to increase the user experience at mobile aplications,
it creates an imersive sensation, through the native elements of each platform.

## Getting started.
_To get started running this code you'll have to install the expo-cli.

Run the following command in your terminal
> $ git clone https://github.com/gabrielmoura33/nubank-clone

Then move to the folder it creates throught the following  command

> cd nubank-clone

Then intall the packages using yarn or npm, run:

> npm i or yarn install

Finally run:

> yarn start or expo start

Happy Hacking! 🤓
